		Short Description:
			The P2P Crypt network it self is designed to facilitate home owners, businesses, 
			and even gamers for audio,video,text or file transfer encrypted communications 
			that is a "Turn-Key" solution for the global masses. 
	 
			The servers' purpose of the network is to stay consistently online, to store messages, 
			relay real-time streams and protect the integrity of everyoneâ€™s public-key.
