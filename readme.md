=========

##Oragnization Details

_Also known as_ 
**Peer 2 Peer Encryption Communications** 
_or for short_ 
**P2P Crypt Comm** 
_to specifically refer to the server but we just like to call it the_ 
**P2P Crypt** 
_when speaking in general about the network._

## Short Description of the source code features.
The P2P Crypt network it self is designed to facilitate home owners, businesses, and even gamers for audio,video,text or file transfer encrypted communications that is a "Turn-Key" solution for the global masses.
The servers' purpose of the __network__ is to stay consistently online, to relay & store messages, 
real-time streams and protect the integrity of everyoneâ€™s public-key.

## List of features

* ###JSON Communication

	Almost any device can read/write in JSON so this was the obvious choice for allowing maximum device flexability to have the server communicate to other requesting networking streams .

* ###No single point of failure

	The source-code is freely available to edit,sell,change and distribute under the X11/MIT license(this applies to only the server code not the client code).
	With enough P2P servers online and more linking into the network everyday; It becomes increasingly harder to analyze the complexity of __who trusts who__ and thus it is
	believed that any attacker will need to spend more on resources for analyzing than they could be attacking; Making the network a low risk target.
